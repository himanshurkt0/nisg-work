As it would not be possible to list out exhaustively the books that would be ineligible for reimbursement, in case of any doubt, decision regarding admissibility of the claims would rest with the ZO in-Charge and CGM, Admin at HO, Lucknow and Mumbai Offices.

2.  The employees may purchase books, as above, as per the eligibility limits, subject to 90% of expenditure incurred. The reimbursement of such expenditure will be made on declaration basis and it will not be necessary for officers to produce the books for verification.
